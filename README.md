# Implementation Prompts due with Milestone 2:

1. **PROCESS SUMMARY**
*Briefly summarize your  implementation process,
including how much your initial design plan evolved,
the final results you achieved, and the amount of time you spent
as a programmer or programmers in accomplishing these results.
This should be one or at most two paragraphs.*

*FIXME*

2. **DESIGN CHALLENGES**
*Describe the primary conceptual challenges that you encountered
in trying to complete this lab and what might have made the
lab easier for you.*

*FIXME*

3. **BIG O ANALYSIS**
*Please analyze the Big O of all of the methods of your class, including all constructors.*

*FIXME*

4. **TESTING**
*Please briefly describe your testing process.
Here you should be careful to select representative input cases,
including both representative typical cases as well as extreme cases.*

*FIXME*

5. **ERRORS**
*List in bulleted form of all known errors
and deficiencies with a very brief explanation.*

- *FIXME*

6. **LEARNING AND REACTION**
*A paragraph or so of your own comments
on what you learned and your reactions to this lab.*

*FIXME*

7. **INTEGRITY STATEMENT**
*INTEGRITY STATEMENT: Please briefly describe ALL help you 
received and all help you gave to others in completing this lab.
Also list all other references. 
If you worked in a pair you must also attested to only 
having worked together as a pair, not separately.*

I did not use any hepl in submitting this assignment

8. **Pairwork statement**
If you worked in a pair of programmers, you are required 
to use good pair programming practices, always working 
together and not using a divide and conquer technique 
in which only one of you does the work and learns. 
Also, the two programmers roles should be switched 
frequently--around every 20 minutes or so. 
If you worked alone, please say so. If you worked in a pair, 
please describe how you worked together.

I worked on it alone
